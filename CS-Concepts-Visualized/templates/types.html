        <p class="lead text-light"> As we have not only numbers but we also have
            alphabets or characters, we need to differentiate between them and let the computer know how much data we want each type to store and what kind of data, so as to ensure correctness
            and optimize memory usage (mostly only needed in simpler programming langauges like C).

            <p class="fs-5">
                In computer science, types define the kind of data a variable can hold and how the operations on that data are performed.
                In C, types are broadly categorized into basic types (like integers and floating-point numbers), derived types (arrays, pointers, etc.), and user-defined types (structs, enums).

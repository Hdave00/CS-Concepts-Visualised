            In the realm of computer science, rubber duck debugging is a simple yet effective technique for debugging code. It involves explaining your code line-by-line to an inanimate object (like a rubber duck), forcing you to articulate your thought process and often spot mistakes you missed before.
            In today's AI reliant code, which removes the link or need for you to think for yourself, which is a very, very valuable skill in all aspects of critical thinking applications, not just Computer Science, 
            rubber ducking can prove to be a huge asset because it forces you to not only spot mistakes, that you may have otherwise missed, but the the concept of talking out loud and hearing your own thought process
            in real time, can help fill in gaps in your train of thought and kind of puts you in a zen like, contained thought process.

            <h3 class="text-light">What is Rubber Duck Debugging?</h3>
            <p class="fs-5">
                The term comes from a story in the book <em>"The Pragmatic Programmer"</em> where a programmer would debug code by explaining it to a rubber duck they kept on their desk. The idea is that by slowing down and carefully describing each line of code, the developer often discovers their own mistake without any outside help.

                            When you're stuck on a bug or an unexpected result, walking through the logic aloud often reveals mismatched assumptions, misunderstood conditions, or faulty loops. It forces you to slow down and focus.

                            It's a great tool for students or learners to reinforce their understanding. Explaining code—even to a non-living thing—improves mental modeling and confidence in concepts.

                            While effective, this technique won't always help with logic errors that seem correct until runtime. And of course, sometimes you do need another pair of eyes to provide a different perspective.

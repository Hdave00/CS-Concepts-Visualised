        <h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
        <p>As we saw in the definiton for arrays, the very nature of arrays allows us to manipulate bits in memory (as bits are stored back-to-back or contiguously in memory).
            Caesar Cipher is one of the first "encryption" method that was used to send cryptic messages with a "key", which arranged the latin alphabets
            into a specific order in such a way that anyone with the key could decipher the message. Ususally one would want to preserve case sensitivity
            and special characters as well, simply because they are an expression that can provide better context to the intended reciever. So if the key is 1,
            the whole alphabet moves to the "right" by 1, A becomes B, C becomes D and so on.
            Below is a simple application to see this in action.

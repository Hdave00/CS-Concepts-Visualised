            <p class="fs-5" style="text-align: left;">
                Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or instructions for solving problems. In computer science, they are used
                to perform calculations, manipulate data, and automate reasoning tasks. The example below demonstrates the
                Bubble Sort algorithm, which is a simple sorting technique. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares
                adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the list is
                fully sorted.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-5" style="text-align: left;">
                Let's take an example of a simple sorting algorithm called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort algorithm is simple to understand and easy to implement, making it a good starting point for
                understanding sorting concepts. It essentially, checks the "left" and "right" or adjascent data in an array in memory, and swaps them as it travrses the data set until the conditions of
                sorting are met. These conditions are usually to arrange/sort the data in ascending or descending. It's time
                complexity is O(nÂ²) in the average and worst cases, meaning it performs best on small or nearly sorted arrays. To see this in

                        Algorithms help automate and make those very large data sets in this context, faster to index specific data in that whole set, displaying ordered lists (e.g., search engine results, e-commerce product listings).
